Connect Four

The purpose of this assignment is to give more practice in working with pointers and dynamic memory. You are required to write a Connect Four like game (Connect N game), except that your game will allow the user to select anywhere from 3 to 5 for the size of “Connection” for displaying and debugging purpose. You can find an example of the Connect Four game at the following web site: http://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

The program starts by asking the user how many connected pieces are needed to win. This number should be 3, 4, or 5. The game board has 3 more columns than the number of connected pieces to win and 2 more rows. For example, if the user selects 5 as the number of connected pieces to win, the game board has 7 rows by 8 columns. Note: The grader will use any random connected pieces other than 3, 4, and 5 to test your program. Here are some requirements about the program:

The first player is the user and the second player is the computer. The computer randomly chooses which column to drop a piece on.
Use the letter 'p' for the player and the letter 'c' for the computer.
Draw the game board between each turn.
Between each turn, your program must check to see if there is a winner or a tie.
Once there is a winner, indicate if it is the player or the computer and quit the program; before quitting, be sure to release any memory that has been allocated for the game board.
Example code has been added at Link (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. Your tasks are to:

Properly create, initialize, and cleanup the dynamically allocated 2d array game board
Implement the checkWinner function
Implement the placePiece function
Implement the printBoard function
Your code must compile with zero errors, zero warnings, and must adhere to the CS 1410 Coding Standards.pdfPreview the documentView in a new window
