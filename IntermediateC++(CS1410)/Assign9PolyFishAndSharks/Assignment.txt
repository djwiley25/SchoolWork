What to write:  sea.cpp

What to turn in:  sea.cpp

In this assignment, you are to simulate a 30x60 cell ocean, which is represented by a 30x60 array of ProtoFish pointers.  Each pointer is either null, points to a Fish, or points to a Shark.

You then simulate the actions of the various fish and sharks as they go about their lives in this little ocean. Fish basically just move around and have baby fish, while sharks must find and eat fish to survive and then have baby sharks.

You are provided with most of the code you need, including slightly modified code from your previous sharks and fish assignment.  Your code must each day make each fish or shark move in the direction it is pointing (if it can), leave a baby in the vacated space (if it is time), and (in the case of sharks) eat any fish in front of them as they move.

All the sharks and fish must be stored in the ProtoFish pointer array, and you must make good use of polymorphism when moving the creatures around.  You must also be careful to avoid moving any creature more than once during each day.

For more details about with functions to implement, see sea.h.
