Ah, the days of automatically-dispensed tobacco products.  Once a ubiquitous fixture of night clubs and bowling alleys, the Art-o-mat vending machine brought a touch of style and elegance to carcinogen-laced inhalant devices. You popped in your quarters, pulled the correct knob, and packet of Lucky Strikes slid down the polished stainless steel chute into your eagerly awaiting nicotine-stained fingers.

In this assignment, you are to write a menu-style program to simulate an updated Art-o-mat.  You program should print the following menu:

      s - report the machine status
      d - drop in a quarter
      1 - pull the 1st knob
      2 - pull the 2nd knob
      3 - pull the 3rd knob
      4 - pull the 4th knob
      r - restock the machine
      q - quit

Any other input should be met with a "I do not understand" response.

Here is an example session (user responses shown in blue):

      s - report the machine status
      d - drop in a quarter
      1 - pull the 1st knob
      2 - pull the 2nd knob
      3 - pull the 3rd knob
      4 - pull the 4th knob
      r - restock the machine
      q - quit

      1: 5 packs of Lucky Strikes
      2: 7 packs of Camels
      3: 1 packs of Gauloises
      4: 6 packs of Pall Malls
      There is $24.50 in the machine

     A pack of Gauloises slides into view.  Gauloises?  Really?

     A grouchy-looking attendent shows up, opens the back, fiddles around a bit, closes it, and leaves.

     So long!

You get the picture.  You are allowed to be inventive in your text and actions, as long as it makes sense within the context of the story.

A few final notes:


1. Each pack of cigarettes cost $0.75.

2. Quarters only and change is not given.  If more than .75 is put into the machine before the knob is pulled, then all the monies goes into the bank.

3. The maximum type of each cigarette when the machine is restocked is 10, and the maintenance person takes all the money.

4. Start the simulation with the settings as shown in the demo above.

Turn in:  a single .cpp file with your code in it.

Your code must compile with zero errors and zero warnings.
