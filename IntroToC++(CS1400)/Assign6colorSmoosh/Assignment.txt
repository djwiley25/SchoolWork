Write a function void Smoosh( that generates a .ppm image named <filename>.ppm of size rows X cols that is colored c1 on the left side, c2 on the right side, and blends smoothly from c1 to c2 throughout the rest of the image.  Put your function into the following code before turning it in (I have placed a copy of this starter code in a file called "smooshStarter.cpp" in the main Google Drive directory for his class):



#include <iostream>

#include <fstream>



using namespace std;



struct Color{

     int r;

     int g;

     int b;

};





void Smoosh(int rows, int cols, Color c1, Color c2, string filename);



//toDo:  write your function(s) here



// end of your code



int main(){

     string bw = "blackToWhite";

     string ry = "redToYellow";

     string fb = "fooToBar";

     Color black; black.r=0; black.g=0; black.b=0;

     Color white; white.r=255; white.g=255; white.b=255;

     Color red; red.r=255; red.g=0; red.b=0;

     Color yellow; yellow.r=255; yellow.g=255; yellow.b=0;

     Color foo; foo.r=21; foo.g=156; foo.b=221;

     Color bar; bar.r=253; bar.g=24; bar.b=129;



     Smoosh(64,256,black,white,bw);

     Smoosh(400,2000,red,yellow,ry);

     Smoosh(234,800,foo,bar,fb);



     return 0;



}



Your code must compile with zero errors and zero warnings
